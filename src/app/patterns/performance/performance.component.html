        <h6>Polyfill</h6>
        <p>
          Because Rivet uses CSS Custom Properties which aren't support by legacy browsers like IE11, it requires a
          small snippet of code in order to function correctly. Add the following snippet to your application to enable
          support in legacy browsers.
        </p>
        <code>import rvtPolyfill from 'rivet-style/lib/rivet-style.polyfill.js';</code><br />
        <code>rvtPolyfill();</code>
        <p>
          If when using this polyfill you are noticing styles "pop in" to the page, you can import a scss style from
          Rivet that works alongside the Javascript snippet you imported above. Add the following to your global
          stylsheet:
        </p>
        <code>@import '~rivet-style/styles/polyfill.scss';</code><br />
        <p>Then add an id attribute with value <code>css-vars-root</code> to your <code>body</code> tag.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h6>IE11 & Animations</h6>
        <p>
          Due to the small percentage of users (and shrinking) that still use IE11, it is only required that IE11 users
          do not lose functionality while operating in our products. There may be instances when certain animations or
          visual effects appear in some browsers but not in IE, and this is acceptable as long as the user does not lose
          functionality or the lack of animations does not cause dramatic changes to the content.
