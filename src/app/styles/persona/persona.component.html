        <h4>What is a Design Persona?</h4>
      </header>
      <blockquote>
        “Following a structure similar to a user persona, you can
        <strong>flesh out your design’s personality</strong> by creating a design persona. Personality can manifest
        itself in an interface <strong>through visual design, copy, and interactions.</strong> A design persona
        describes how to channel personality in each of these areas and helps the web team to construct a
        <strong>unified and consistent result.</strong>”
        <br />
        -Aarron Walter in “Designing for Emotion”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The Design Persona is used to create and design a product that engages users emotionally in order to create a
        positive and memorable experience. This document serves as a framework for making product and design decisions,
        ensuring that every decision made creates a unified and consistent experience in NaviPlan.

        <h3>Voice</h3>
        <h4>How does NaviPlan sound?</h4>
      </header>
      <h5>Voice Overview</h5>
      <p>
        NaviPlan is incredibly knowledgeable and confident, yet it does not feel the need to prove this. It does not
        rely on verbose formality to convey its knowledge, rather, efficiency and clarity are valued over excessively
        academic vocabulary. NaviPlan understands different users are at different levels of understanding and will
        tailor its language accordingly to fulfill the ultimate goal of helping people better understand the world.
        NaviPlan uses a scientific and precise feel, manifesting from the navigational theme found in imagery,
        differentiating itself from competitors. It never veers into an overly clever territory, instead, NaviPlan is
        focused on engaging users in conversation and resolving problems to promote an emotional connection.
      </p>

      <h5>Copy Examples</h5>
      <strong>When guiding newer or less knowledgeable</strong>
      <p>NaviPlan uses clear, plain-English explanations and instructions.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "More information is needed before a report can be generated. Fill out your client's information and try again."
        <br /><br />
        "You need to enter an income before continuing."
        <br /><br />
        "The description field contains invalid characters. Only use alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 1-9) characters in the
        description field."
      </blockquote>

      <strong>When working with more experienced users or complex topics</strong>
      <p>NaviPlan is efficient but rigorously precise with explanations and wording.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "Holdings are investment products, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. These can be used to fund a client's
        goals."
      </blockquote>

      <strong>When things are going well</strong>
      <p>NaviPlan is not afraid to let you know and congratulate you, but it will not dwell on it.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "Your report has been successfully generated." <br /><br />
        "Client's information has been updated. Continue?"
      </blockquote>

      <strong>When something goes wrong</strong>
      <p>NaviPlan immediately lets you know that there is a problem, where it is, and how to fix it.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "The error in this field must be fixed before proceeding." <br /><br />
        "We need more information about your client before we can generate insights. Try adding your clients’ incomes."
        <br /><br />
        "Continue and remove transfer records? This account is associated with one or more transfer records. Changing
        either the Account Type or Owner will delete these associated items from your plan. Where applicable, proceeds
        and distributions will be directed into Cash Flow."

        <h3>Visual Lexicon</h3>
        <h4>What does NaviPlan look like?</h4>
      </header>
      <h5>Colors</h5>
      <p>
        NaviPlan’s color palette uses more neutral colors with instances of bright colors to convey a sense of
        professionalism, yet remain inviting and fun for the user. In NaviPlan, there is consistent use of gold and
        purple colors to emphasize structure. The purpose of these colors is to enable a smooth, intuitive flow through
        the application.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../../../assets/persona/Purple.png" alt="Primary purple color swatches"/>
        <figcaption>
          Purple is used to guide you to different action elements, such as buttons and checkboxes. The more vibrant the
          element, the more likely that it is something useful to the task at hand.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <div class="gold"></div>
        <figcaption>
          Gold will always be used to highlight elements that help you understand where you are. This is found in top
          and side navigation bars as well as on the tabs within a given page.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="../../../assets/persona/Gray.png" alt="Gray color swatches"/>
        <figcaption>
          Grey is used as the base for the app, keeping a clean and streamlined feel.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="../../../assets/persona/DataViz.png" alt="Data color swatches"/>
        <figcaption>
          The data visualization colors are bright and easy to see, bringing users eyes to important graphs and elements
          in the app where their data is displayed.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h5>Typography</h5>
      <p>
        NaviPlan is powerful, clear, and efficient, and its typography reflects it. Simple, sans-serif headings and a
        body copy appropriately varied in scale and weight communicate information hierarchy. The dark grey color and
        clean lines of Nunito Sans make NaviPlan feel like a trusted analytical tool that is both functional and easy to
        use.
      </p>
      <img src="../../../assets/persona/Type_Light.png" />

      <h5>Illustration</h5>
      <p>
        NaviPlan uses elements that are flat and simple, keeping the tool easy to understand, clean, and not
        intimidating. Illustrations use lines and light color fills to complete a space without making it feel busy and
        unclear. Purple should be the main color used in the lines and fills of illustrations, gold can be brought in
        when elements are large enough or in an area that calls for more detail. NaviPlan uses illustrations sparingly
        and only in areas that can afford an added element, such as empty states or modal selections.
      </p>
      <div class="ill-container">
            <strong>These illustration guidelines should be followed:</strong>
            <img src="../../../assets/persona/illustrations.jpg" />
      </div>

      <h5>Shadows/Elevation</h5>
        <p>
            NaviPlan uses shadows and elevation in elements that overlap other elements on a page
            when opened, expanded, hovered, etc. Shadows are light and have a high blur, this allows
            the shadow to elevate the element without making it too distinguished or distracting to
            the user. This shadow guideline should be followed: -2px y-axis, 0px x-axis, 10px blur,
            2px spread, and (0,0,0,6) color. NaviPlan uses shadows and elevation sparingly and only
            in areas such as dropdown, tooltips, side panels, list buttons, datepickers, and snackbars.

        <h3>Engagement Methods</h3>
        <h4>How does NaviPlan interact with users?</h4>
      </header>
      <h5>Surprise & Delight</h5>
      <p>
        NaviPlan changes the aerial photography images on login screens each release for both the NaviPlan financial
        planning tool and the NaviPlan Administration tool.
      </p>
      <img src="../../../assets/persona/engage.jpg" />
      <p>
        NaviPlan uses micro-interactions on elements to entice the user to continue working through the tool. These
        micro-interactions are slight but enough to be noticeable, interesting, and unexpected to the user.
      </p>

      <h5>Anticipation</h5>
      <p>
        NaviPlan uses Pendo to add Coming Soon and What’s New popups into the tool, allowing the user to anticipate and
        understand new features, calculations, or design elements.
      </p>
      <img src="../../../assets/persona/anticipate.jpg" />
      <h5>Velvet Rope & Status</h5>
      <p>
        NaviPlan uses Beta or User Testing on chosen user groups for new features, calculations, or design elements.
        This limited access to new product elements helps elicit a feeling of exclusivity, allowing the user to
        anticipate and feel an elevated perceived status.
